# Architecture documents

This section contains the architecture documentens that are used in this project.

In the [ArchitectureDoc](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GreenhouseWaterkersAI/blob/main/ArchitectureDocuments/ArchitectureDoc.pdf) you can find a flowcart
overview with all the block components that are used. Devided in a software block and a hardwareblock.
The hardwareblock contains a Raspberry Pi 5, a Sense Hat that is connected to the headerpins of the Raspberry Pi and a cameramodule for the Raspberry Pi.
The datasheets of the Raspberry Pi 5 can be found under the [RaspberryPi5Datasheet](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GreenhouseWaterkersAI/blob/main/ArchitectureDocuments/RaspberryPi5Datasheet.pdf) file and the drawing can be found under the [RaspberryPi5Drawing](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GreenhouseWaterkersAI/blob/main/ArchitectureDocuments/RaspberryPi5Drawing.pdf). A lot of additional information can be found on the website of [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#raspberry-pi-5) documentation. The

We have 2 blocks, a hardware block, that contains all the hardware components that are used, and a software block that contains all the software that is used.
The datasheets of the Raspberry Pi 5 can be found under the [RaspberryPi5Drawing.pdf](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GreenhouseWaterkersAI/blob/main/ArchitectureDocuments/RaspberryPi5Datasheet.pdf) file and the drawing can be found under the [RaspberryPi5Drawing.pdf](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GreenhouseWaterkersAI/blob/main/ArchitectureDocuments/RaspberryPi5Drawing.pdf)
