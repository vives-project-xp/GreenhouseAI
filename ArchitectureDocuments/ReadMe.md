# Architecture documents 

This section contains the architecture documentens to build this project from scratch. 
In the [ArchitectureDoc.pdf](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GreenhouseWaterkersAI/blob/main/ArchitectureDocuments/ArchitectureDoc.pdf) you can find an flowcart
overview with all the block components that are used. Devided in a software block and a hardwareblock. 
An overview flowchart can be found under the [ArchitectureDoc](https://github.com/vives-project-xp/GreenhouseWaterkersAI/blob/main/ArchitectureDocuments/ArchitectureDoc.pdf),
there you can find the main components that are used in this project. 
We have 2 blocks, a hardware block, that contains all the hardware components that are used, and a software block that contains all the software that is used.
The datasheets of the Raspberry Pi 5 can be found under the
