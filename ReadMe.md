## The project
The watercress AI project has the main goal of creating a working AI model which is then deployed on an embedded device. The challanges in this project lay in the gathering of our own data to create a labeled dataset. Following that the model has to be chosen and trained to garantee the best possible result. Ultimately the model has to run on an embedded device. The project is deemed succesfull when we can make accurate prediction using a camera on the chosen embedded device and then display this in a way (display).

### Goals
26/09 Planting the watercress, Order materials
03/10 Testing with sample data (as watercress was not visible on pictures yet)
17/10 Full dataset from day 1 till day 20
24/10 Trained model 
07/11 Dashboard to display model
22/11 Deployment on edge device (perhabs with casing)

## Materials and software

## Proces
We chose to start of by predicting the age of the watercress. For this we created our own dataset by planting the watercress ourself. Each day we made pictures, labeled them and added them to the dataset.
